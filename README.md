# Real-Time-RR-Interval-Detection-in-ECG-Signals
The Pan-Tompkins algorithm has been widely used due to its effectiveness in accurately detecting R-peaks in various ECG signal conditions,
including those with noise, baseline wander, and other artifacts.
It provides a reliable and efficient method for extracting vital cardiac information from ECG signals and serves as a fundamental step in many ECG-based applications,
such as arrhythmia detection, heart rate monitoring, and clinical diagnosis.
